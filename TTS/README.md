Digitalent - Text To Speech

Text to speech just like the name describes, converts your text into speech. In order to do this it goes through the following steps. The text is converted into phonetic text, then it passes through a system that will define how to pronounce each word in order to reconstruct the sence and produce the information associating the phonetic writing with the tone and required length of the pronunciation, finally, the sound is generated by selecting the best units stocked in a acoustic database.

## Run
In the root of the `TTS` folder run the command:
`$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000`

Open the browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
